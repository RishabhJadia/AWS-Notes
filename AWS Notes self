AWS Notes:
cloud computing - pay-as-you-go pricing
cloud computing deployment models:
	cloud based
	on-premises/private cloud
	hybrid


Amazon EC2 (elastic compute cloud):

	cost save -->pay for running instances not for terminated/stop instances
	sharing underlying hardware--->multitenancy
	resizable
	support vertical scaling--> at run time, can increase/decrease memmory/cpu
	horizontally-->adding new instances

EC2 types:
	cpu, memory, storage, networking
	general purpose-->good for web services/code repo, support -->compute, networking, memory 
	compute optimize-->good for high performance computing, processors, batch processing ex: gaming, scientific modelling
	memory optimize-->good for memory related task, high performance database i.e., requires large amounts of data to be preloaded before running an application
	accelerated optimize-->good for number calculation, graphic processing, hardware
	storage optimize-->good for high performance for local stored data it includes, DFS, OLTP, data warehouse

	IOPS(Input/Ouput operations per second)-->measure performance of storage device. i.e., how many different I/O operations a device can perrform in one second

EC2 pricing:
	on-demand--> for short term, irregular workloads --> pay for compute time use only
	EC2 saving plan--> reduce compute costs by committing to a fixed amount of compute usage for a 1-year or 3-year term
	reserved instance-->billing discounted applied to use of on-demnd instance. --> it has standard reserved, convertible reserved (1/3 year), scheduled reserved (1 year)
	spot instance-->for flexible start and end date ex:- survey
	dedicated hosts-->are physical server with amazon ec2 instace full capacity to use. More Expensve

EC2 auto scaling:
	anytime can add/remove instance

	approches:
		dynamic scaling
		predictive scaling

Elastic Load balance:--> it takes the requests and routes them to the instances.
	
Messaging and queuing:placing messages into buffer
	services:
		SQS(Simple queue service)-->allow send, store, receive b/w software components
		SNS(simple notification service)-->send out messages to services/end users

Serverless computing:
	AWS Lambda
	Fargate is a serverless compute platform for ECS or EKS
	ECS or EKS are container based

Region:-->geographical area that contains AWS resources.
	Amazon CloudFront -->
		retrives the data from edge location (cache data). is a content delivery service.
		
		edge location--> is a data center that an AWS service uses to perform service-specific operations  and also for speed delivery

	AWS Outposts --> is a service that can use to run AWS infrastructure, services, and tools in own on-premises data center in a hybrid approach

	Amazon cloud formation--> Infrastructure as code where we are preparing the templates/script to automitcally create the service. If any defects found then it rollback automatically. 


AWS resources:
	AWS Elastic Beanstalk-->provide code and configure. Free services
		Adjust capacity
		Load balancing
		Automatic scaling
		Application health monitoring

Networking:
	public 
	VPC(virtual private cloud)-->is private network in aws. allow peopple if they are coming from approved network
	subnets-->chunks of ip addresses that allow to group resource (ec2 instance) together
		subnet is a section of a virtual private cloud (VPC) in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs.

		public subnets -->  contain resources that need to be accessible by the public (ec2 instance) and have access to the internet gateway
		private subnets--> contain resources that need to be accessible by the private (database) and do not have access to the internet gatway
	Direct Connect--> establish a completely private, dedicated fiber connection from  data center to AWS. It reduce network cost increase amount of network that travel

Internet gatway -->
	- VPC to the internet.
	- connection between a VPC and the internet. It allows public traffic from the internet to access a VPC.

Access control list:-->is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. bydefault all are blocked (port/ip address). It is stateless
	Stateless controls-->it always checks its list. allow all inbound and outbound traffic

Security group--> is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.
	Stateful controls--> deny all inbound and outbound traffic

DNS:
	Route 53--> is a dns service
		DNS resolution is the process of translating a domain name to an IP address.
		Connect user requests to infrastructure in AWS and outside of AWS.


Storage:
	Instance store volume-->temporary block level storage. Which store data temporary when ec2 stop/terminate. all data gets deleted.
	EBS- To overcome from Instance store volumne and if you dont want to delete entire db on stopping of ec2 instance. Then EBS comes in picture.
		EBS Volume --> it ia virtual hard drive. provide the backup called snapshots.
		EBS snapshot --> is an incremental backup

		EBS and EC2 instance both are in same AZ.

	S3-->allow to store and retrive unlimited amount of data at any scale 
		s3 storage classes:
			S3 Standard--> Frequent and rapid access of data. Hosting static website (html, css, js)
			S3 Infrequent Access (IA)--> Less frequent and rapid access of data. backup, disaster recovery files and long term files. Has minimum 3 AZ.
			S3 1 zone IA--> Has 1 AZ only.
			S3 Intelligent Teir--> Check the access pattern and move the data from S3 IA to S3 Standard and vice-versa.
			S3 Glacier --> Less frequent and less rapid access of data. data archived in s3 glacier (inform of vault). We can access data from vault using vault lock policy. We can set policy in vault using WRITE ONCE READ MANY. Once policy locked can not changed. retrive objects from minutes to few hours.
			S3 Life Cycle-->Here, we define configuration which will automatically move data. ex: s3 standard-90 days --> s3 IA-30 days--> s3 glacier - 120 days   
			S3 Glacier deep Archive --> retrive of archived objects within 12 hour

		Storage VS Block level storage:
			Storage level -->store files completely. every time there's a change to the object, you must re-upload the entire file and has no delta updates.
			Block Level-->Store files in blocks. every time there's a change to the object, engine only updates the blocks where those bits live.

	Amazon Elastic File System--> is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. As you add and remove files, Amazon EFS grows and shrinks automatically. It can scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications. 

		EFS is regional service and available in multiple AZ.
		AWS direct connect-->
			- On-primses servers can access AWS EFS
			- AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and VPC without using public internet




The private connection that AWS Direct Connect provides helps you to reduce network costs and increase the amount of bandwidth that can travel through your network.

	RDS--> 
		Amazon Aurora--> Its is an enterprise class relational db. It comes in two form MySQL and Postgresql.  If your workloads require high availability. It replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones and continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3.

pricing and support:
	AWS Free Tier:
		always free
		12 months
		trail

How AWS pricing works
	Pay for what you use.
	Pay less when you reserve.
	Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more

AWS Lambda:
	For AWS Lambda, you are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time that it takes for them to run.

 	AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.

Amazon EC2:
	With Amazon EC2, you pay for only the compute time that you use while your instances are running.
	Spot Instance would provide you with up to 90% cost savings while still meeting the availability requirements of your workload.

Amazon S3:
	Storage - You pay for only the storage that you use. You are charged the rate to store objects in your Amazon S3 buckets based on your objects’ sizes, storage classes, and how long you have stored each object during the month.

	Requests and data retrievals - You pay for requests made to your Amazon S3 objects and buckets. For example, suppose that you are storing photo files in Amazon S3 buckets and hosting them on a website.

	Data transfer - There is no cost to transfer data between different Amazon S3 buckets or from Amazon S3 to other services within the same AWS Region.

	Management and replication - You pay for the storage management features that you have enabled on your account’s Amazon S3 buckets. These features include Amazon S3 inventory, analytics, and object tagging.
